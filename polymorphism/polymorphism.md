# what is polymorphism ?
## -> polymorphism is allows us to perform a single action in different ways. its one of the the core principle of opps concept.

# type of polymorphism  
## -> 1. compile time polymorphism/static polymorphism 2.run-time polymorphism/dynamic polymorphism

## compile time polymorphism/static polymorphism :
### -> this type of polymorphism is achived using function overloading.

## run - time polymorphism/dynamic polymorphism :
### -> this type of polymorphism is achived using function overriding.

# key point of polymorphism :

## function overloading polymorphism : same function name with different parameters the same scope .

## if derived class defined same function as defined int it base class its is knowns as function overriding .
