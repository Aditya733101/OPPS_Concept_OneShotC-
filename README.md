# OOP Concepts Defined
### In this section, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc

## 1. Abstraction
### Definition
Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes relevant to the problem and working at a higher level of generality.

### Real-World Example
**Coffee Machine**: As a user, you only interact with essential featuresâ€”adding water, coffee grounds, and pressing the start button. The internal workings, such as heating water and brewing coffee, are abstracted away from you.

## 2. Encapsulation
### Definition
Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit, or class, and restricts direct access to some components.

### Real-World Example
**Medical Record**: A patient's medical records are kept secure within a file, accessible only to authorized personnel.

## 3. Inheritance
### Definition
Inheritance allows a new class (child) to inherit properties and behavior from an existing class (parent), promoting code reusability.

### Real-World Example
**Vehicle Hierarchy**: A general class `Vehicle` with common properties like speed and capacity can be inherited by specific classes like `Car` and `Bicycle`. Each subclass adds particular attributes and methods while inheriting the general features of `Vehicle`.
