#  Encapsulation : wrepping up of data and information in a single unit .while controlling access to them .data hiding /informoration 


## advantage of enpacapsulation:
### 1. protecet sensitive data;
### 2. if we want to we can make class read only
### 3. code reusability of  data.        

## what is the real world example :
### - the car engine is complex and has many internal part but we dont need to understand how the car engine works .instead without knowing how the car engine works but we know how to control the break and ecceletors of the car engine.
